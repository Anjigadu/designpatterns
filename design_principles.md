Design principles 
==================

*These points you should always keep in back of your mind.*


1. Identify the aspects that vary from the applications and separate them from what stays same.

2. Program to supertype not for implementation

3. Favor Composition over Inheritance.

4. Strive for loosely coupled design between objects that interact.

5. Classes should be open for extension but closed for Change.

6. Depends upon abstractions not on concrete implementations. (dependency inversion principle)

7. Principle of Lease knowledge - talk only to your immediate friends.

8. Hollywood principle - Don't call us, we'll call you.

9. A class should have only one reason to change.
