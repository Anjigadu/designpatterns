Honourable Mentions
===================

  These are not part of the standard design patterns but due to their wide practical usage they're worth mentioning

### 1. Simple Factory pattern

> A simple Factory class have a static/ non static method to create and return the instance.
  
### 2. Null Object pattern

> When we don't have a meaningful object ro return and also want to remove the responsibility of client to handle the NULL.
Ex: NoCommand, EmptyStatement, NoResult, etc
