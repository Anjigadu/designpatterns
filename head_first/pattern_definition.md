Design Patterns
================

This File contains the definitions for the standard design patterns.

### 1. Strategy Pattern

> It defines the family of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them, and makes them interchangeable.
 Strategy lets the algorithms changes, independently from the client uses it.

### 2. Observer Pattern

> It defines the One to Many relationship between the objects. So when one object changes its state, the dependents get notified and updated automatically.

### 3. Decorator Pattern

> It attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### 4. Factory Method Pattern

> It defines interface for creating instances but lets the sub classes to decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets the class to defer instantiation to its sub classes.

### 5. Abstract Factory Pattern

> It provides an interface for creating family of related / dependent objects without specifying its concrete classes.

### 6. Singleton Pattern

> It ensures that the class has only one instance to it and provides global point of access to it.

### 7. Command Pattern

> It allows you to encapsulate the requests as an object, and thereby lets you parameterize the other objects with different requests,queue or logs and support undoable operations

### 8. Adapter Pattern

> It converts the interface of a class into the interface that client expects. Adapter lets class to work together that couldn't otherwise due to incompatible interfaces.
