This File contains the definitions for the design patterns.

1. Strategy Pattern

It defines the family of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithms changes, independently from the client uses it.

2. Observer Pattern

It defines the One to Many relationship between the objects. So when one object changes its state, the dependents get notified and updated automatically.

3. Decorator Pattern

It attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

4. Factory Method Pattern
It defines interface for creating instances but lets the sub classes to decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets the class to defer instantiation to its sub classes.
